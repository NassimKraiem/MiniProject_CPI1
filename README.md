# MiniProject
This project is a library management application developed as a semester project for college by Nassim Kraiem. The software was created using Python programming language and GUI was designed using PyQt5 and QtDesigner. The application is designed to help manage and organize library resources such as books in a user-friendly manner.

The library management app includes features such as a database to store information about books, students, ..., as well as functions to search for and locate specific items in the library's collection. The app also provides an easy way to check out and return items, as well as track borrowing history.

The project helped me learn valuable skills in software development, and I hope that it can be helpful for anyone looking for a practical and efficient solution for managing library resources.
